# My WebCam Theremin

I built this using [handtrack.js](https://victordibia.github.io/handtrack.js/#/) and the awesome [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)

To get started, just clone this repo, cd into it, run 'npm' install, and open index.html! I hope to add a lot more features soon. 



I blogged about using some of this technology and figuring out the ways to use it if you check my [medium](https://medium.com/@larry.sassainsworth).
